This is the first big project.

I think at this point, I'm just hoping I can get through it smoothly. So far everything is going smoothly and I'm a little bit impressed with how much I remember from previous experience. My last time coding was circa 2018 so it's been a few years.

Anyway, I'm not too worried about the HTML itself. My hopes for this project are to demonstrate clear and effective git committ messages. If the HTML gets messy along the way, I guess that's just bonus learning!
